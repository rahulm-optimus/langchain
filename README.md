## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure LangChain projects
- Work with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Create sophisticated prompt templates
- Build chains and agents
- Implement memory for stateful conversations
- Create custom tools for agents
- Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
- Deploy production-ready AI agents

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, loops)
- Python 3.10 or higher installed
- Familiarity with virtual environments (we'll help you set up)
- **NO API KEY REQUIRED!** - We use FREE models (Ollama recommended)
  - Alternative: Free Groq API key (optional)
  - Alternative: Free HuggingFace token (optional)

## 📖 How to Use This Course

1. Follow the lessons in numerical order
2. Read the README.md in each folder for theory
3. Study the example code files
4. Complete the exercises (marked as TODO)
5. Experiment and modify the examples

## 🛠️ Setup Requirements

### Quick Start (FREE Models):
1. **Read SETUP_FREE_MODELS.md** for detailed instructions
2. **Install Ollama** (recommended) - https://ollama.ai/download
3. Run: `ollama pull llama3.2`
4. **That's it!** No API keys needed!

### Alternative FREE Options:
- **Groq** - Fast & free API (get key at console.groq.com)
- **HuggingFace** - Many free models (get token at huggingface.co)

Each lesson folder contains:
- `README.md` - Concept explanation and learning objectives
- `example.py` - Working example code (uses FREE models)
- `exercises.py` - Practice exercises (selected lessons)
- Additional files as needed
