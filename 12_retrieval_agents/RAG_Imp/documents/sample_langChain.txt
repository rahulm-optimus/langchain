LangGraph — Overview & How It Differs from LangChain
What Is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a framework built on top of LangChain for creating stateful, reliable, multi-step agent workflows using graphs.
It enables deterministic agent behavior with explicit control over loops, retries, branching, and checkpoints.
It is designed for production-grade, multi-agent, and long-running workflows.

LangGraph vs LangChain — Key Differences
Feature	LangChain	LangGraph
Purpose	Tools, prompts, chains, agents	State-driven workflows and agent orchestration
Execution Model	Linear pipelines	Graph-based transitions
Loops & Branching	Hard to manage	First-class support
Determinism	Often unpredictable	Explicit and reproducible
Memory	Local per chain	Global shared state
Multi-Agent Systems	Manual setup	Built-in design patterns
Reliability	Medium	High (checkpoints, recovery)

Summary:
LangChain provides components (LLMs, tools, prompts, memory).
LangGraph provides the architecture for how those components interact using graph-based workflows.

How Agents Are Created Using LangGraph

LangGraph structures an agent as a graph with:

State: Shared memory across nodes

Nodes: Functions, LLM calls, tools, sub-agents

Edges: Logic determining which node executes next

Checkpoints: Persistent snapshots for reliability

A typical LangGraph agent workflow:

Define the state model

Implement nodes (e.g., reasoning, tool call, validation)

Add conditional edges for flow control

Compile the graph into an agent

Run the agent with inputs

This approach makes agent behavior transparent and predictable compared to standard LangChain agents, which rely on model reasoning for control flow.

What Is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP is a standardized protocol that allows LLMs to access external tools and systems through isolated tool servers.
These tools can include:

Databases

Filesystems

Cloud APIs

Browsers

Custom business logic

Each tool runs in its own secure environment, and the LLM interacts with them using a typed, structured protocol.

Why MCP?

Safe, sandboxed execution

Works with any LLM model

Local and cloud support

Standardized, reusable, versioned tools

How MCP Works With LangChain and LangGraph
MCP + LangChain

LangChain can load MCP tool servers and convert them into LangChain tools.
This allows LLMs to call:

SQL tools

Search tools

File tools

Custom data processors

LangChain serves as the bridge between the LLM and the external system.

MCP + LangGraph

LangGraph integrates MCP tools within its nodes, enabling reliable, multi-step workflows using MCP-based capabilities.

Within LangGraph:

LLM nodes decide when to call MCP tools

Tool nodes execute securely

Checkpoints preserve tool results

Control flow handles retries and branching

Multiple agents can coordinate using MCP tools
