# Lesson 1: Introduction to LangChain

## 📖 What is LangChain?

LangChain is a powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides tools and abstractions to make it easier to build complex LLM applications.

## 🎯 Why Use LangChain?

### Problems LangChain Solves:
1. **Complexity Management** - Simplifies working with LLMs
2. **Modularity** - Reusable components for common patterns
3. **Chain Management** - Easily combine multiple LLM calls
4. **Agent Framework** - Build autonomous AI agents
5. **Memory Management** - Handle conversation history
6. **Tool Integration** - Connect LLMs to external tools and APIs

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

### 1. **Models**
- Language models (LLMs) for text generation
- Chat models for conversational interfaces
- Embeddings for semantic search

### 2. **Prompts**
- Templates for dynamic prompt creation
- Few-shot learning examples
- Prompt optimization

### 3. **Chains**
- Combine multiple components
- Sequential operations
- Complex workflows

### 4. **Agents**
- Autonomous decision-making
- Tool usage
- Reasoning and planning

### 5. **Memory**
- Conversation history
- Context management
- State persistence

### 6. **Indexes**
- Document loading
- Text splitting
- Vector stores

## 🎯 What You'll Build

Throughout this course, you'll learn to build:
- Simple chatbots
- Question-answering systems
- Web search agents
